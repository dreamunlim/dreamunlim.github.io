    <h1>HOW TO PLAY</h1>
    <p>
        Visually divide the screen in half. Tap either on the left or right screen part to move hero left or right. Or use
        keyboard Left/Right arrows to move hero and select buttons; Esc/Enter to pause; Up/Down arrows to select a hero.
        Moving hero into the screen edge teleports him to the opposite side. You have 10 seconds for action. Catch the
        falling objects to score points: +3 for hearts, +4 for stars, +5 for diamond, +6 for booster, and +7 for watermelon.
        Pick up the booster dice to recharge the timer and yield a random points multiplier in the range from 3 to 7 that
        will last from 3 to 5 seconds. Pick up the watermelon to obtain a revive. The spiders are the ones to avoid.
        Colliding with them will cost a revive or end the game if you are out of watermelons. Spider attack speed is
        increased every 50 points earned and reaches maximum from 300 points. In case spider is attacking booster at the
        same time with you, you will get 1 second immunity if your booster attack is synced precisely with the spider✨
